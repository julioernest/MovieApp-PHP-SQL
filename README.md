# MovieApp-PHP-SQL
I developed a site with the purpose to learn front end and database connection/SQL syntax. It is inspired by IMBD and Netflix.

# Set-up de code!
In order to use the code I suggest download and install the XAMPP version 8.0.1 (contains MariaDB, PHP).
1. Pull the github repo on your local.
2. Take every file from folders and move it in
XAMPP/htdocs/"yourDataBaseName" (mine was Filme), as it shown in the image.
